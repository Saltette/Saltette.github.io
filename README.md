Phase 2 of Kalos timer for noteworthy cooldowns

## Usage

If this is your first time using this timer, it's recommended to only use P2 Start, Binds, Test, Cleanse, FMA buttons to time systems and FMA with everything else cancelled.

Press the "P2 Start" button once the cutscene of the dog turns completely black, phasing into p2 of Kalos.

Gray buttons should be pressed when they occur.

Ideally, white buttons are never pressed. They are to adjust for timings, phase, and number of systems in case of misclicks.

Binds affect FMA timer. Test Start and Fail affect FMA timer and systems timer. FMA may affect systems timer. HP % affects breath timer.

Lasers and Arrows timers will loop automatically.
