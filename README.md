Phase 2 of Kalos timer for noteworthy cooldowns

## Usage

Press the P2 Start" button one or two seconds after the cutscene of the dog turns completely black, phasing into p2 of Kalos.

Ideally, white buttons are never pressed. They are to adjust for timings, phase, and number of systems in case of misclicks by the timer.

Black buttons, Cleanse, FMA, Breath, Dive, Bombs, Lasers, and Arrows should be pressed at the exact time.

Bombs, Lasers, and Arrows timers will loop automatically. Bombs will most likely de-sync depending on server lag.

FMA timer may not be accurate with a Wild Hunter or Zero in your party.
